[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
None of that could ever make me leave

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
And when we're making love
Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need's between those thighs

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you (oh yeah, oh yeah babe)
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

[Verse 3: Kali Uchis]
And I’ll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, it’s all just memories
La-la-la-la-la

[Bridge: Daniel Caesar]
If you've got someone you like
(Don't you love when I come around)
Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody
(Build you up then I take you down)
If you've got someone you like
(Don't you love when I come around)
Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody
(Build you up then I take...)

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you (oh yeah, oh yeah babe)
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

[Outro: Kali Uchis]
This feels like summer
Boy you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Boy you'll lead me to paradise

[Intro: H.E.R.]
Oh, hey

[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are

[Pre-Chorus 1: H.E.R.]
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Daniel Caesar]
I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie

Oh you're the best part, oh
Then you're the best part, ooh
Best part

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
It's this sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love
It makes me feel so nice

[Pre-Chorus 2: Daniel Caesar]
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, ooh
Best part

[Outro: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Love me, won't you?

[Intro]
Could you, could you say? "I love you Danny"
You want me to?
Could you?
I love you Danny

[Chorus]
If you love me baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favorite
First you love me then you leave me in the basement
I know I'm your favourite
If you love me baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favourite
First you love me then you leave me on the pavement
I know I'm your favourite

[Verse]
I got this girl, she's making me crazy
I nearly let her have all my babies
Pussy so good, it sets me on fire
I leave myself, I elevate higher
You're fly girl, but you're headed to maybe
I'll take the time, treat you like a lady
My life's a spectacle, a sad story
Perhaps I'll find my way to the glory, yes

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m the one that took you to higher heights
That's what I was trying to do
I know you had your dreams of a better life
This time we ain't making it through

[Chorus]
If you love me baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favourite
First you love me then you leave me in the basement
I know I'm your favourite
If you love me baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favourite
First you love me then you leave me on the pavement
I know I'm your favourite

[Bridge]
You're getting on a plane
And travelling far away
You've left me with the pain
I carry it everyday
Who do you think you are
Some kind of celebrity?
Just wait and see

[Outro]
I never asked for much only that you stay true
Need I remind you all the things I do for you?
Who can I blame, I played the game
Well just for now
I was wondering can you hold me down
I was wondering can you hold me down

[Verse 1]
There are times I think about that fateful day
I threw your love away
Every time I see that look upon your face
The same one that you made
When your fragile world was crashing down around you
You realized your place
And the darkness that you try so hard to subdue
It causes you to change
But baby, baby, please don't leave me (please don't leave me)
I know I made a big mistake, don't turn my sunshine to shade
Baby, please don't leave me (please don't leave me)
I know this is a game we play
You're always taking my breath away

[Verse 2]
Should've left you a long time ago
All my niggas done told me so
But my niggas don't hold me tight
When I'm sleeping in my bed at night, only you
Should've left a long time ago
All my niggas done told me so
But my niggas don't hold me tight
When I'm sleeping in my bed at night, only you
Babe, I know I fucked up
Fucked with some empty cups
But you got your friends too
But you got your friends too
Better believe it
In truth I'm up on my luck, can't stop running amok
But you got your friends too
But you got your friends too
Better believe it, I

[Verse]
If you ever start to wonder
Why all the rain and all the thunder
Follows her around
You better cut that girl loose
Most of time, everything's fine
But as soon as she starts to whine
If you have no patience
You better cut that girl loose

What are you, a coward?
Who are you helping?
You got the power
Then do it yourself, king
And do it for her
You better cut that girl loose, ah
Set her free, let her be
Leave her be (oh yes)

[Outro: Daniel Caesar, **Girl (unknown)**]
You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
See you walking out the door
Wonder why it took you so long
Ever since the day that I met you
Knew you were the girl of my dreams
(phone rings)
But we could never be
**Hello?**
**Yeah, Sorry, I was I was just getting everything [out] right now
I'll be outside**
(hangs up phone)
**Sorry, I was actually just gonna take my phone**
Take it
**I wrote down a new phone number if you need it**

[Verse 1]
You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
See you walking out that door
Wonder why it took you so long
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you were the girl of my dreams
But we could never be
You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song

[Chorus]
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up

[Verse 2]
You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
You need someone you adore
Find a place where you might belong
Ever since the day that I met you
My world's been spinning out of control
I just need you to hold

[Bridge]
We knew it'd come around
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh
Pieces all on the ground
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh
We knew it'd come around (We find love)
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh (We get up)
Pieces all on the ground (Then we fall down)
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh (We give up)
We knew it'd come around (We find love)
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh (We get up)
Pieces all on the ground (Then we fall down)
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh (We give up)
Heaven help us, heaven help us, yeah
We're on our own

[Chorus]
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, yeah, we get up
We fall down, we give up

[Verse 1]
Everywhere that I go, everywhere that I be
If you were not surrounding me with your energy
I don't wanna be there, don't wanna be anywhere
Anyplace that I can't feel you, I just wanna be near you

[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could I swear I'd go back
Make everything all better, whoa

[Verse 2]
It's the things that you say
It's the way that you prey
Prey on my insecurities
I know you're feelin' me
I know sometimes I do wrong
But hear the words of this song
When I go I don't stay gone for long
Don't know what's going on

[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could I swear I'd go back
Make everything all better, whoa

[Bridge]
And I'm coming back home to you
And I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home

[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could I swear I'll go back
Make everything all better, whoa

[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
Now it's time to sit back and enjoy creation
See what Jah has done
Every time she tops me off, it's celebration, yeah
What has life become?
And we don't talk too much
Could this be a strange new love I've got
Plus she's always got that loud pack
Inspiration for this soundtrack
Every time she throws that ass back, all she says is

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
Every time I go inside of your protected
Place with reverence
I'm reminded of a time I was neglected
It seems you're heaven sent
She loves to top me off
She's cut from the finest cloth, my love
Plus, we like to take it easy
All she wants to do is please me
Every time I'm on that TV, calls me up, says

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & Syd]
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away (Won't you please take me away baby, 'way baby)
(Won't you please take me away)
Take me away (I like the way you say my name baby, name baby)
(Won't you please take me away)
Take me away
Take me away

[Outro: Syd]
Wherever you go, just take me, take me, take me
Would you take me, baby
Take (Take me away)
Want you take me away, take me away (Take me)
Take me away, take me away
If it's the last thing
Want you to take me away, take me away (Take me)
Take me away, take me away
Take me

[Intro: Daniel Caesar]
If a leopard never changes it's spots
How can I change what I've got?
Transform, transform, transform, transform
We don't punish the tiger for catching it's prey
So how am I the one to blame
If it's in my nature?
Transform, transform, transform, transform

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
And I don't know why I fight it
The least I could do is try
But ego's in the way
I know that you feel mad today
But that anger will fade away
And you'll wish she was here

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
It's never over until life ends
Lay down beside me, do it again
It's never over until life ends, yeah
Lay down beside

[Verse 1: Charlotte Day Wilson]
Don't be a fool, baby I know you've changed
It's in my nature and it's okay (it's okay)
And I'll be your goddess and you a part of me
Lay down your pride, lay down with me

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
So ugly but you love me
Keep nobody else above me
And that's why I keep you around
Ain't it funny, now you're money
Act like you don't know nobody
What goes round gon' come back around

[Chorus: Charlotte Day Wilson]
It's never over until life ends
Lay down beside me, do it again
It's never over until life ends, yeah
Lay down beside me

[Bridge: Daniel Caesar]
You're my violet in the sun
You're the chosen one
You're my violet in the sun
You're the chosen one
You're my violet in the sun
You're the chosen one

[Outro: Daniel Caesar]
Can't quit you, you're like drugs
Swear I tried to clean up
Too much shared between us
Saved my soul like Jesus
Can't quit you, you're like drugs
Swear I tried to clean up
Too much shared between us
Saved my soul like Jesus

[Verse 1 : Daniel Caesar]
You are the reason
The reason I sing
I have to preserve you
'Cause you're my everything
Babe I know I fucked up
Fucked with some empty cups
But you got your friends too
Better believe in it
Truth I'm up on my luck
Can't stop running amok
But you got your friends too

[Chorus : Daniel Caesar]
I just want to thank you for saving my life, Yes
I just want to thank you for all your advice

[Verse 2 : Daniel Caesar]
You are the reason, the reason I'm alive
I must bring you honour
If I don't, I'll die
Ma', I know I brought shame
Put a mark on your name
But you got your thangs too, better believe it I'm
Rising up from the flames
The phoenix that I became
But you got your thangs too
Oh, help me sing

[Chorus : Daniel Caesar & Choir]
I just want to thank you for giving me life yes
I just want to thank you for all your advice

[Bridge : Choir & Daniel Caesar]
Send me kisses when it's grey skies
Its been so long, look how time flies
If you love me won't you let me know
I've been trying to learn let you go
Call my name whenever tears fall
When you face your fears you stand tall, oohh, ooohh
Send me kisses when it's grey skies
(can't you see...)
Its been so long, look how time flies
(I'm spending all...)
If you love me won't you let me know
(...This time)
I've been trying to learn let you go
Call my name whenever tears fall
(Come with me)
When you face your fears you stand tall, oohh
(I hope we can...)
Ooohh
(...Rewind)

[Verse 3 : Daniel Caesar]
Know I'd take a bullet for you
No you don't know what I go through
And I know you think you're kind of nice
Do you remember when I saved your life?
Don't come at me on some weak shit
It's time you stopped displaying weakness, ooh, ohh

[Skit: Sean Leon]
Hey mama
It's your second son, still the same, ain't changed momma
Made some change
Times have changed on me
Times have changed (minds have changed)
And mine feels strange mama
I feel ashamed (what could I say to you face to face with my fate, I lost my faith)
Face to face with my fate momma, I lost my faith

[Silent Interlude]

[Outro : Daniel Caesar]
Isn't it nice
Human sacrifice
The universe got it
I got too excited
And now we're taking life
Isn't it nice
Human sacrifice
I hate consequences, that shit's too expensive
You keep chasing delight
Isn't it nice
Human sacrifice
I take the easy way out every time
Don't deserve my own life
Isn't it nice
Human sacrifice oh yes
They say I'm a martyr
Charge that to my ego
I just want all the lights
