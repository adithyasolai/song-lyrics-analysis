# song-lyrics-analysis
Utilizes built-in Java Maps and Sets to determine the frequency of words and phrases and the amount of unique words found in song lyrics of artists such as Frank Ocean, Daniel Caesar, and Aesop Rock. Frank Ocean and Daniel Caesar lyrics were selected to be compared to each other because fans of their music have noted that Frank Ocean has more repetitive and simple lyrics than his contemporary Daniel Caesar. I selected Aesop Rock because a different lyrics study I read online found that Aesop Rock has the most unique word % out of any hip-hop artist ever, so I wanted to see those numbers for myself. As expected, a staggering 32% of Aesop Rock's lyrics are unique words. Unexpectedly, however, Frank Ocean actually has a higher % of unique words (22%) than Daniel Caesar (18%).
